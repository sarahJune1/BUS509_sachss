###### Module Introduction:

In this module, we will learn about how to analyze the difference of variance between groups, called ANOVA. This builds upon our X2 distribution and testing approaches and allows us to inform our decision about the differences between groups using statistics. We will also discuss some of the caveats when discretizing groups, called Simpson's paradox.

###### Module Learning Objectives:  

1.  Conduct and evaluate a one-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) test
2.  Fisher's LSD
3.  Tukey's HSD
4.  Conduct and evaluate a two-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) test
5.  Simpson's paradox
