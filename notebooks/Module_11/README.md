###### Module Introduction:

Oh-my-goodness of fit! In this module, we will build upon the previous discussion of the X2 distribution and use it to make inferences about the population variance. We will conduct goodness-of-fit to test our hypothesis of difference between two or more population proportions, independence, and homogeneity. 

###### Module Learning Objectives:  

1.  Make inferences about the ratio of two population variances
2.  Conduct goodness-of-fit test for more than two population proportions
3.  Conduct goodness-of-fit test for independence
4.  Conduct goodness-of-fit test for homogeneity/normalcy
5.  Conduct Jarque-Bera test
