###### Module Introduction:

In this module, we will be covering the topics of numerical descriptive measures. This provides the foundation for analyzing data as information.

###### Module Learning Objectives:  

1.  Calculate and interpret central tendency
2.  Interpret percentiles and boxplots
3.  Calculate and interpret the mean, variance, and standard deviation
4.  Explain mean-variance analysis and the Sharpe ratio
5.  Apply Chebyshev's theorem, the empirical rule, and z-scores
6.  Calculate and interpret measures of association
