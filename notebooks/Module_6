###### Module Introduction:

In this module, we will shift from discrete probability distributions into continuous probability distributions. The section focuses on the normal distribution but will also cover the exponential and lognormal distributions.   
  

###### Module Learning Objectives:  

1.  Describe continuous random variable
2.  Calculate and interpret probabilities for a random variable under the uniform distribution
3.  Explain the characteristics of the normal distribution 
4.  Calculate and interpret probabilities for the normal distribution
5.  Calculate and interpret probabilities for the exponential distribution
6.  Calculate and interpret probabilities for the lognormal distribution
