# Module Introduction:

This module includes topics on probability distributions. This will build upon the previous module of probability with new concepts about measuring and interpreting summary measures. We will learn about randomness and different distributions such as binomial, Poisson, and hypergeometric. 

## Module Learning Objectives:  

1.  Describe discrete random variable and its probability distribution
2.  Calculate and interpret summary measures for a discrete random variable
3.  Calculate and interpret probabilities for a binomial random variable
4.  Calculate and interpret probabilities for a Poisson random variable
5.  Calculate and interpret probabilities for a hypergeometric random variable
